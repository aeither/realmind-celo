# Egg Empire - Action Plan

## Concept
Fully onchain Tamagotchi-style game where users tap to collect eggs, evolve them, and compete on leaderboards.

## Core Mechanics

### Egg System
- **Tap to Earn**: Each transaction earns eggs
- **Evolution**: Spend eggs to upgrade/evolve
- **Daily Claim**: Collect bonus eggs daily

### Smart Contract Actions
```solidity
layEgg()           // Tap action - earn eggs
evolveEggs()       // Spend eggs to evolve
setReferral()      // Set referrer address
buySeasonPass()    // Premium features
dailyClaim()       // Daily rewards
```

## Leaderboards (Dual System)
1. **XP Leaderboard**: Based on total eggs spent (investment ranking)
2. **Tap Leaderboard**: Based on transaction count (activity ranking)

## Referral System
- Users set referral address
- Both referrer and referee receive bonus eggs
- Onchain attribution tracking
