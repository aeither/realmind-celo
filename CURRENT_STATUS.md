# üîç Current Status - Self Protocol Integration

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

The backend now:
1. ‚úÖ **Uses fallback for `scope`** - Will use `SELF_SCOPE` env var if not in request
2. ‚úÖ **Uses fallback for `userIdentifier`** - Will extract from proof if not in request
3. ‚úÖ **Logs EVERYTHING** - Shows all fields received for easy debugging
4. ‚úÖ **Handles multiple field name variations** - Checks all possible names

## üîß Current Issue

The Self mobile app is sending the proof but **NOT sending these fields**:
- ‚ùå `scope` (backend now uses fallback)
- ‚ùå `userIdentifier` (backend will extract from proof)

This is likely because of the **`endpointType`** configuration.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Option 1: Try with `endpointType: "mainnet_https"`

Update `/src/components/SelfVerification.tsx` line 41:

```typescript
// Change from:
endpointType: "https",

// To:
endpointType: "mainnet_https",
```

### Option 2: Keep current config and deploy

The backend is now smart enough to handle missing fields with fallbacks!

### Deploy Backend NOW

```bash
cd backend
vercel --prod
```

Make sure these environment variables are set on Vercel:
```env
SELF_APP_NAME=Realmind Celo
SELF_SCOPE=realmind-celo  ‚Üê IMPORTANT! This is the fallback
SELF_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://forno.celo.org
```

### Test and Check Logs

1. Deploy backend
2. Test with Self mobile app
3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

## üìä What the Logs Will Show

You'll see:
```
[Self Verify] ==================== NEW REQUEST ====================
[Self Verify] Request body keys: [list of all fields]
[Self Verify] Full request body: {...}
[Self Verify] Searching for user identifier in all fields...
[Self Verify] Extracted fields: {...}
[Self Verify] ‚ö†Ô∏è scope not in request, using configured fallback: realmind-celo
[Self Verify] ‚ö†Ô∏è userIdentifier not in request, will extract from proof
[Self Verify] ‚úÖ All required fields present (with fallbacks where needed)
[Self Verify] Using scope: realmind-celo
[Self Verify] Using userIdentifier: WILL_BE_EXTRACTED_FROM_PROOF
```

## üöÄ Expected Behavior After Deploy

### If it WORKS:
```
[Self Verify] ‚úÖ Verification successful
[SelfService] Extracted user identifier from proof: 0x...
```

### If it still FAILS:
The logs will show:
- What fields the Self app actually sent
- What fields are missing
- Any errors from the verifier

Share the full log output and we can fix the exact issue!

## üîç Debugging Checklist

- [ ] Backend deployed to Vercel
- [ ] `SELF_SCOPE=realmind-celo` set on Vercel
- [ ] `SELF_APP_NAME=Realmind Celo` set on Vercel
- [ ] `SELF_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://forno.celo.org` set on Vercel
- [ ] Frontend `.env` has correct backend URL
- [ ] QR code displays properly
- [ ] Self mobile app can scan QR code
- [ ] Vercel logs are being monitored

## üìù What Each `endpointType` Means

| Value | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `"https"` | Generic HTTPS endpoint | May not send all fields properly |
| `"mainnet_https"` | Production HTTPS | **Recommended** for production backends |
| `"staging_https"` | Self Protocol staging | For testing with Self's staging infrastructure |

## üéØ My Recommendation

1. **Try `endpointType: "mainnet_https"` first**
2. **Deploy the backend** (it has fallbacks now)
3. **Check the logs** to see what fields are actually sent
4. **Share the logs** if it still doesn't work

The comprehensive logging will tell us EXACTLY what's going on! üîç
